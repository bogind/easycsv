\arguments{
  \item{urlAddress}{
  a URL address of the zipped file, if NULL then Israeli GTFS will be downloaded and added to env.
  }
  \item{txt}{
  logical. if TRUE .txt files will be loaded as tables instead of .csv
  }
  \item{encoding}{
  character. files encoding. can be NULL
  }
  \item{stringsAsFactors}{
  logical: should character vectors be converted to factors? Note that this is overridden by as.is and colClasses, both of which allow finer control.
  }
  \item{header}{
  a logical value indicating whether the files contain the names of the variables as its first line. If missing, the value is determined from the file format: header is set to TRUE if and only if the first row contains one fewer field than the number of columns.
  }
  \item{quote}{
  the set of quoting characters. To disable quoting altogether, use quote = "". See scan for the behaviour on quotes embedded in quotes. Quoting is only considered for columns read as character, which is all of them unless colClasses is specified.
  }
  \item{fill}{
  logical. If TRUE then in case the rows have unequal length, blank fields are implicitly added.
  }
  \item{comment.char}{
  character: a character vector of length one containing a single character or an empty string. Use "" to turn off the interpretation of comments altogether.
  }
}

\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use

%% ...
A data frame (http://127.0.0.1:10235/help/library/utils/help/data.frame) containing a representation of the data in the file.
